            I’m a very outgoing and easy-going person. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring nature with friends, going for long (or short) walks, or eating… a lot
            Asian food is definitely my favorite. 🌿🍜

            I love music and dancing — even if I’m not the best dancer, I enjoy it like crazy. Concerts, raves, and long music sets on YouTube are my thing. I listen to all kinds of genres, and every week or two I discover a new artist or set that I can’t stop replaying. 🎶🕺

            Most of all, I love spending time with friends: sunny days, BBQs, a few beers, and long conversations about life. Simple moments, good vibes. 🍻🔥
